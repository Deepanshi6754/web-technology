    <h1>GitHUB</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based interface allowing real-time collaboration. It encourages teams to work together in
        developing code, building web pages and updating content. Read on for a quick introduction to GitHub, who uses
        it, and why.</p>
    <p>GitHub is useful in the development stage for code, content, research, web pages, and more. With GitHub, you can
        easily track changes and navigate revisions. That explains its popularity with so many users. This article
        describes how to use GitHub, its benefits, and where you might encounter it professionally, as well as how to
        use it personally.</p>
    <h1>What is GitHub used for?</h1>
    <p>GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any member of a team can
        access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time.
        Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see. GitHub also lets users make requests
        of one another and internally discuss the iterations along the way. It’s even been called “a social coding
        platform” because it invites people to coordinate, share, and collaborate code across distributed and
        asynchronous environments</p>
